# Basic Setup
## OS X: Revealing the Library directory
Snapshots and Logs are saved to _Users>Username>Library>Application Support>Interface_

Recent versions of OSX hide the Library directory/folder by default, and it must be enabled through the Terminal with this command: `"chflags nohidden ~/Library/â€œ`

If you prefer a less permanent way to go to the User Library folder:
Finder --> Go --> press the Alt key --> then you can select the Library folder

4. Enable Network Streaming under Tracking>Network>Faceshift Network
5. Enable Faceshift (TCP) in Interface under Developer>Avatar Options
