The following document outlines how code should be commented in order for documentation to automatically be generated with Doxygen.

Node that comments need not be included to every method and member variable. Where the functionality of either is obvious based on the method signature or naming comments may be omitted. Doxygen will still show these elements, but will no added documentation.

###Classes
Add a brief description to the class by using a C++ style comment with an additional slash.

    /// Handles input and output of audio for interface client
    class Audio : public QObject { 

The HTML generated by Doxygen will have the following:

![class comment](http://f.cl.ly/items/3A0z1h0W3I2c3d2x1F3p/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-14%20at%201.20.27%20PM.png)

###Methods
Add appropriate comments to a method using the following comment style.

    /// Processes a received audio packet
    /// \param unsigned char* receivedData the received packet
    /// \param int receivedBytes the number of bytes received
    /// \return int number of samples processed
    /// \thread network receive
    int addReceivedAudioToBuffer(unsigned char* receivedData, int receivedBytes);

The first line in the comment is a brief description of the method.
Parameters to the method begin with `\param`, then the type of the parameter, the name of the parameter, and a brief description of the parameter.
The method return begins with `\return`, then the type of the return and a brief description
The `\thread` tag is an optional custom tag to designate which thread the method must be called on (if not the main thread).

The HTML generated by Doxygen will have the following:

![method comments](http://f.cl.ly/items/1T273V1r0C2c2E1Z2P0c/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-14%20at%201.22.50%20PM.png)

###Member Variables

Add a brief description to ambiguous member variables by following them with a C++ style comment with an additional slash and the less-than sign.

`float _lastInputLoudness; ///< average loudness of signal from microphone for last frame`

The HTML generated by Doxygen will have the following:

![member variable comment](http://f.cl.ly/items/0S2I1f0A3u41292m1u3o/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-14%20at%201.31.31%20PM.png)
