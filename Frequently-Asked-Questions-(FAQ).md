Frequently Asked Questions for HiFi non-developers

HiFi is supported on Windows, OSX, and Linux.

### What VR support is available?
- **Headsets**: Oculus Rift will be supported shortly.

### Why do in-world avatars look flat and blocky?
The client will attempt to drop avatar detail until your frame rate is above 30. If it can't do that, then all avatars will appear as billboards.

### Are there any pre-made avatars?
Yes! Go to Edit/Preferences and click on the magnifying glass icons next to the "Head" and "Body" URLs. You should see a dialog allowing you to choose from a set of preexisting models.
